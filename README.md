Download the .py file and run it in your computer (make sure you have Python installed). From the Python Shell, you can test the function using different approaches:

``` python
anagram("berna", "zurich")
```

``` python
input1 = "turing"
input2 = "lovelace"
anagram(input1, input2)
```

``` python
anagram("samba", "masba")
```

The Boolean values _True_ or _False_ will be displayed on the screen, depending on the input.
